# Grafana Checklist
- ✅ The panels should have proper heading with units.
- ✅ The Panels should have transparent background (found in edit option).
- ✅ The vertical height should be same of two similar (i.e. two timeseries) side by side panels.
- ✅ The horizonal width should be same of two similar (i.e two barcharts) consecutive panels.
- ✅ The time markers of the timeseries should match with the timeseries above it.
- ✅ The units should be there inside the panels (i.e. axis in case of timeseries)
- ✅ When plotting multiple timeseries in a single panel, make sure they have visibly differentiable colors.
- ✅ For timeseries like temperature, pressure,  humidity etc. use **Gradient Mode:** *Scheme* and **Color Scheme:** *Red-Yellow-Green or others*.
- ✅ Change the display name to actual parameter name from query name.
