PyCOZIR
=======

PyCOZIR is a Python interface to COZIR™ CO2 sensors.

This module wraps the communication on a serial port with a COZIR CO2 sensor.
It gives a higher level API than the serial communication protocol.

Implemented functionalities:

* data reading (CO2, temperature and humidity)
* sensor configuration (digital filter, calibration, ...)

This code is freely available under a 3-Clause BSD license (see `LICENSE <./LICENSE>`_ file).


Usage
-----

Create a connection to a sensor connected to serial port '/dev/ttyUSB0'::

    >>> from cozir import Cozir
    >>> c = Cozir('/dev/ttyUSB0')
    connected to "/dev/ttyUSB0"
    set operating mode to "polling"

Read data from sensors::

    >>> print('CO2: {} ppm'.format(c.read_CO2()))
    CO2: 1189.0 ppm
    >>> print('Temp: {} °C'.format(c.read_temperature()))
    Temp: 27.3 °C
    >>> print('Humid: {} %'.format(c.read_humidity()))
    Humid: 39.3 %

note: temperature and humidity sensors are an optional add-on in COZIR sensors.


Compatibility
-------------

This module was tested with Python 3.6, under Linux, but is meant to work
under Windows as well.

Not currently tested with Python 2.7, but version *before June 2017* was compatible.

Data logger
-----------

A simple data logging script is provided.
It runs from the command line and save the data in CSV format in file::

    $ python logger.py /dev/ttyUSB0
    connected to "/dev/ttyUSB0"
    set operating mode to "polling"
    logging to "cozir_log_2015-09-14_12-01-10.csv"
    logging interval: 30 s
    1077 ppm, 22.0 °C, 52.6 %
    ...


The filename of the logfile is created based on datetime at startup.
